The Restrict property of Directive specifies where the directive is to be detected : as element or attribute

function MyDirective(){
	var ddo = {
		restrict : "AE",

	};
	return ddo;
}

If the restrict property is not specified then Angular will default it to "AE".
A- attribute, E-element =>  Angular tries to detect the directive either as an Attribute or Element

If there is a mismatch between the definition and usage then Angular will ignore it.
