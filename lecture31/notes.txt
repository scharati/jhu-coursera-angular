Directive Link Function:
Mechanism to manipulate the DOM directly.

function MyDirectiveFunction(){
    var ddo = {
        scope{

        },
        controller:MyDirectiveController,
        bindToController: true,
        controllerAs: 'list',
        link: MyDirectiveLink ---> specifies the function which does the work of DOM manipulation
    }
}

function MyDirectiveLink(scope,element,attrs,controller){

}


NOTE: injection cannot be done to the link function. So the parameters are passed

scope: the scope available to the directive controller [NOT injected]
element: The top level element of the directive [ if the directive is an attribute then the element is the element on which this directive is defined as an attribue] -> This is a minimal JQuery object called JQLite
If 'jquery' library is included in the page before 'angular' then this would be the full-fledged JQuery object
attrs: references to the attributes defined on the 'element'
controller: if there is a controller declared for the directive then this is that controller
