Controllers inside directives:

Directives have to serve as self sufficient units that means they have to have their own controllers

function myDirective{
	var ddo = {
		templateUrl : "...",
		scope = {}
		controller: <ControllerFunction>, --> specifies the controller for the directive
		bindToController : true, -> implies that the properties on the scope are stored on the controller - >alias.property instead on the $scope object
		controllerAs: 'alias', -> the controller instance will be available on the scope as $scope.alias = controller
	}
}

scope bindings inside directive better use "<" for non-primitive types so that unnecessary watchers are not added inside the directives
