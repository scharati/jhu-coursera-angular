Expression and interpolation:

Expression is something which evaluates to some value.
Interpolation is the process of evaluating the expression and a value as result is produced.

Some key aspects of the expression:
	expression is restricted to evaluating the properties sourced from the $scope service
	i.e the properties are those available on the $scope service.
	If there is any TypeError or Reference error then there is no error shown instead
	no value is displayed
	The expression is bound to the scope and any changes to the variable on $scope affects
	the expression. => results in triggering of expression evaluation


In Angular JS expressions are specified by the following notation:

{{ expression }}

expression can be normal variable or function variable.

expression = name ($scope.name)
expression = sayHello() ($scope.sayHello)
