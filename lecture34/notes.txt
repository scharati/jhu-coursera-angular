AngularJS event system:

Angular JS event system implements the publish-subscribe pattern.
Publishers send messages to Subscribers on a common channel

In Angular the common channel is : scope
Messages are events that can hold data

Publishing an Event :
1. $scope.$emit
$emit goes UP the chain

2. $scope.$broadcast:
$broadcast goes DOWN the chain

Subscribing to an event:
$scope.on(<eventName>, <eventHandler>)

If the target is not in the scope chain then $rootscope.$broadcast can be used
$rootscope as the name implies refers to the ROOT scope of the application

STEPS:

1.Broadcase or Emit an Event:
$scope.$emit('namespace:eventName',{prop:value})
$scope.$broadcast('namespace:eventName',{prop:value})

2.Listen and Handle the Event:
$scope.$on('namespace:eventName',handler);

handler ->
function handler(event, data){

}
