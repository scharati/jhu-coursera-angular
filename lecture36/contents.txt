Routing:

Routing is the concept of navigating between different urls.In the earlier Web1.0 paradigm the interaction between client and server went something like this;

client ----------------------/myurl1----> server
   |<----------------------myurl1 resource-|

client ----------------------/myurl1?id=2----> server
   |<----------------------myurl1id2 resource-|

notice that for every interaction the server sends the whole page content to the server


Web2.0 has a different approach and is less taxing on the user and results in better usability


client ----------------------/myurl1----> server
   |<----------------------myurl1 resource-|

client ----------------------#/myurl1?id=2---|   server
  |------------------------------------------|

Here the 2nd call does not go to the server but the client itself serves that url.


There is another way of Routing which is based on states. States represent the JavaScript object representation of the view to be displayed and work without a url associated with them.

ui.router is a community built routing mechanism for AngularJS and it can provide both Url based routing and state based routing

Steps for using ui-router

1. reference is HTML after reference to Angular.js

2. ui-view is an intial place holder provided by ui-router for inserting different views . This has to be inserted in the SPA html.
<body>
    <ui-view> </ui-view> --> content will be loaded in <ui-view>
</body>

3. declare ui-router as dependency

angular.module('app',['ui-router']);

4. configure routes in .config method

angular.module('app')
.config(RoutesConfig);

RoutesConfig.$inject = ['$stateProvider','$urlRouterProvider'];

function RoutesConfig($stateProvider,urlRouterProvider){
    $stateProvider.state{'<stateName',{
                            url: '/url1' -----> optional
                            template/templateUrl : <html/html_template_path>
    }

  }

  $urlRouterProvider
    .otherwise('/view1'); --> the default url to serve

}
state method is chainable

ui-sref is the attribute which can refer to the state in html

 <a ui-sref="stateName">  TAB1 </a>

ui-sref-active is the attribute which can refer to the CSS class to be applied when the particular html element is added to the <ui-view>

<a ui-sref="state" ui-sref-active="cssClass_to_apply">  TAB1 </a>
