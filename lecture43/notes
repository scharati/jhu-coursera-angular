Unit testing Javascript with Jasmine

Unit Testing :

It is independent checking for proper operation of the smallest testable part of an application
	independent => isolated from the rest of the system [ all dependent systems are mocked out i.e. they have some dummy object which provide the necessary inputs. This is so that we concentrate ton the operation of the unit that we are interested in]

	Mocking => It is a technique employed in Testing where dependency and its behavior is faked.

Jasmine -> JavaScript testing framework

components of Jasmine framework:

src => is where application source code is stored

spec => is where the test specifications are stored

Spec :

describe("<test_suite_name>",function(){
	
	beforeEach(function(){ -----> optional , invoked before each test

	});

	it("<description_of_test>",function(){ --> the test

	});

})


describe function acts as the container for ALL the tests that we are going to run
