Desired characteristics of code base:

1. find easily the relevant code in the code base -> modularity
2. updating one part of code should not affect other parts - modularity,isolation
3. code reusability
4. testability 


Some problems like coding style, missing comments etc can be solved by formatting.

The most important issue that leads to code complexity is low cohesion and high coupling.

Cohesion - is the conceptual integrity of the code unit i.e. the code should demostrate a singlre responsibility

The desired property is high cohesion -> the code unit should have related functionalities which come from the the same single responsibility


Dependency: The wiring between different units to function. 

The desirable property is to have low dependency so that any change would not result in ripple effect i.e. the change will not require many components to change
