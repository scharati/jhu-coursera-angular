ng-if, ng-show and ng-hide

ng-if is a directive that is used to render a element based on the evaluation of some expression

syntax :
<htmlElement ng-if="expression">
if the expression is true then ONLY the htmlElement is added to the DOM

ng-show and ng-hide are directives that are used to render a element based on the evaluation of some expression
The difference with ng-if is that they are in the DOM but their visibility is controlled by Angular using some CSS classes

syntax :
<htmlElement ng-show="expression">
if the expression is true then ONLY the htmlElement is shown in DOM
<htmlElement ng-hide="expression">
if the expression is true then ONLY the htmlElement is NOT shown in DOM
