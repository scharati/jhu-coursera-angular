Router state transition events:


->ui-router exposes numerous state change events that our code is able to listen for
->All ui-router events are fired on the $rootScope

->$stateChangeStart -> starts the state transition
    call event.preventDefault() to prevent the transition

->$stateChangeSuccess indicates successful transition end

->$stateChangeError indicates that the transition failed, including having errors in the resolve
    -> Listen for this event to catch ALL errors during state changes
