Routing state with Nested views:

Nested views are as the name suggests nested inside a parent view. Nested views establish a concept of parent - child views

Nested states are a mechanism to establish nested views logically.

Parent state template has an "ui-view" in its template for the child state's template to insert its HTML

Child state name is usually declared with syntax "parent.child"

The optionally declared url of the child gets concatenated to the declared url of the parent

The parent's resolve property is inherited by the child and is injectable directly into the child's controller


steps:

1. setuo the child state (nested state)

.state('view1.child',{      --> child state of view1
    url:'/detail/{param}' ---> this gets appended to the parent URL
    templateUrl : 'viewDetail.html'
})

1a. the parent's template should have <ui-view> for the child template to get inserted

2. resolve properties are inherited

parent:

.state('view1',{
    resolve:{
        mydata : 'someVal'
    }
});

child:

.state('view1.child',{
    contoller: "ChildCtrl as child"
});

This is possible:

ChildCtrl.$inject = ['myData'];
function ChildCtrl(myData){};
