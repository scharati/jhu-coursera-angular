Databinding : 1-way, 2-way and one time binding

1. 2-way data binding
2-Way data binding is when we have wiring setup between DOM element and property on $scope. Any update to $scope.<propertyName> triggers updated to the bound DOM element

<input type"text" ng-model="name">

Maps the "input" element to the $scope.name property

2. 1-Way data binding
As the name implies the data flow is uni-directional
Expression and interpolation are examples of 1-way data binding

{{name}}

Changes to the $scope.name property are updated at the location of the expression

3.One time data binding

This a one time binding between the DOM element and property on $scope object. 

{{::fullname}}  implies that there is a binding with $scope.fullname property and it's only updated once
