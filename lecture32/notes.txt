Directive : Transclude

A mechanism to pass template content from parent template to directive. The content which is passed to the directive is evaluated in the parent context.

var ddo ={

    scope:{
     transclude: true -> marking on the directive that we want transclusion
    }
}

main_template:

<html>

<my-directive id="1">
    My content1111
</my-directive>


<my-directive id="2">
    My content2222
</my-directive>

<html>


directive_template:
<div> DIRECTIVE </div>
<div class="myDirectiveClass" ng-transclude> </div>


Result:

<html>

<div> DIRECTIVE </div>
<div> My content1111 </div>

<div> DIRECTIVE </div>
<div> My content2222 </div>


<html>


The content from the usage of my-directive is evaluated and taken from the parent template and inserted at the place where "ng-transclude" is specified in the my-directive template definition
