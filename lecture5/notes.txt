The Angular JS framework is built on the MVVM pattern

Model - is the raw data behind the view [ recieved from the server probably]
View - Presentation of the data
ViewModel - The model / state of the view

$scope is the service / mechanism for sharing data between view and model

example:

<input type="text" ng-model="name">

=> the value in input element is bound to the "name" property on $scope service
